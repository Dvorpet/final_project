Welcome in repository for Petr's final project.

- The main goal of this project is to access publicly available data regarding cars for offer from popular online car market [Carvago](https://www.carvago.cz/) with an aim on cars from brand [Skoda](https://carvago.com/cs/auta/skoda).

- Then, publicly available data were used to create a comprehensive dataset consisting of several attributes of cars. 

- Obtained dataset was then modified for a use in simple OLS model and dataset is divided into several subsets by countries. Effects of independent variables on dependent variables are aggregated into one dataframe and then compared.  

- Project is structured as follows:
    1) Getting links for cars offers
    2) Scraping cars attributees and data preparation
    3) Data inspection
    4) OLS model: data preparation and fitting
    5) Creating subsets and getting results
